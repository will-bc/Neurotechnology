üçä All neurodata analysis will need to go through mathematical techniques to be able to be understood. Think of it as a decoding, a secret that only math skills combined with an understanding of context bring answers.

Mostly I will bring the use of EEG data. Depending on which neurotechnology you are using, some mathematical decoding steps may change.

The data goes through 4 major phases:

- Preprocessing
Basically elimination of unwanted noise or signals.

- Feature Extraction
Among the desired signals, how would you like to visualize them, what mathematical language would you like to use as a tool to manipulate them.

- Feature Selection
Selection of conditions to be analyzed, relaxed vs stressed vs happy.

-  Classification
Statistical analysis and classification of patterns in the data: true, false, outliers, close, etc.

In Feature Extraction and Selection analyzes they can be reversed, it depends a lot on the data analyst.

  Making an analogy, imagine that our analysis is the act of eating tangerines üçä. Initially, we need to remove the entire tangerine peel because we are not interested in that (preprocessing). Then we need to remove as much white lint as we have patience, either to visualize the buds or to feel the flavor better depending on whether you want it more bitter or sweet (Feature Extraction). With only the buds remaining, now we separate only the most vigorous ones, the big ones, because we don't care about the rotten ones or the small ones that don't even have much broth (Feature Selection). When we put it in our mouth and feel the flavor, we think, huuumm this is sweet or ewww this one is still too green and sour, at that moment we classify if we managed to reach our goal, to eat a tasty tangerine (classification).
