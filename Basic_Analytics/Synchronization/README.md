# Synchronization

I like to classify synchronization as a phenomenon of two or more artifacts (events, numbers, things, livings, values, etc) following response patterns in conjunction.  The logic of these systems following together can be variated and not intuitive sometimes. 

In Statistics, we can find several analyses that try to detect synchronizations. It's applied in diverse knowledge domains.

### Bivariate 

	- [ ] Cross Correlation
	- [ ] Cross Coherence
	- [ ] Mutual Information
	- [ ] Phase Locking

### Multivariate

	- [ ] Omega Complexity
	- [ ] S-Estimator
	- [ ] Renyi Entropy
	- [ ] Multivariate Phase
	- [ ] Global Field
