# Project Resume :seedling:

Technodruid design is a neuroartistic artifact. We drew a line of provocation and possibilities not only to reframe the interaction of plants with humans but to suggest a future in which we could feel plants; forests; animals and the planet more closely. The human being has mirroring; imitation and empathy skills, but these are neural circuits that need to be trained.
