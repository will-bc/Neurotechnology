# Synchronization

I like to classify synchronization as a phenomenon of two or more artifacts (events, numbers, things, livings, values, etc) following response patterns in conjunction.  
We can find several analyses that try to detect synchronizations. It's applied in diverse knowledge domains.

Math ways to detect synchronizations:

### Bivariate 

	- [ ] Cross Correlation
	- [ ] Cross Coherence
	- [ ] Mutual Information
	- [x] [Phase Locking](https://github.com/will-bc/Neurotechnology/tree/main/Basic_Analytics/Synchronization/Phase_Synchronization)

### Multivariate

	- [ ] Omega Complexity
	- [ ] S-Estimator
	- [ ] Renyi Entropy
	- [ ] Multivariate Phase
	- [ ] Global Field
